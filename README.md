You are to create a JavaScript based simulator of a card game where you play against the
Computer.
The game is composed of 1 or more rounds. In each round, you and the Computer player will
pick a card from the deck. After picking your card, it will be added to your existing cards from
previous rounds to produce a sum. Each Player then needs to decide whether to pick another
card or stay for the remainder of the game. Each Player is vying to create a sum as close as
possible to 25 without going over. Going over means you lose (or tie).
The player that is closest to 25 without going over wins. The number of cards does not impact
the overall score except when there is a tie.
